# NRW permissions prototype

This is the code for the [NRW permissions prototype](https://permissions-prototype.onrender.com/) that was built during the [Learn by making](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/) lab series.

## Requirements

This prototype is based on [a lightly modified version of the GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/lbm-prototype-kit).

To run, it requires:

* node 18+

And a commandline to run it.

If you have access to a commandline tool, such as terminal on mac or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on Windows then we recommend using that.

If you can't install things on your machine then we recommend using [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Codepsaces lets you edit and run the code via the browser - you won't be required to install anything.


## Getting started

If you have matched the requirements you can

Install prototype by running

```
npm install
```

in the commandline.

Start it by running

```
npm start
```

## Hosting

It is currently hosted on [Render.com](https://render.com/) (a host platform with a free tier). Other hosting options include [Railway](https://railway.app/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and any other hosting platform that the GOVUK Prototype kit can run on.
